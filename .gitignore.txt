    # Migrations - IMPORTANT for collaborative projects
    # Generally, you want to track initial migration files, but ignore subsequent auto-generated ones
    # if you regenerate them frequently, or if you're working in a team where migrations might conflict.
    # For now, we'll keep the __init__.py but ignore specific migration files.
